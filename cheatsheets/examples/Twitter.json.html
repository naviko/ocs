<div style='padding:5px;'>Congratulations to Boris Johnson on becoming the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He will be great!</div>
<div style='padding:5px;'>Boris Johnson has won the support of fewer than 100,000 unrepresentative Conservative Party members by promising tax cuts for the richest, presenting himself as the bankers' friend, and pushing for a damaging No Deal Brexit.

But he hasn't won the support of our country.</div>
<div style='padding:5px;'>The News: Boris Johnson becoming PM; Britain heading for hottest day in its history. Or to put it another way: we are literally entering hell.</div>
<div style='padding:5px;'>6,000,000 sign petition to revoke Article 50:
"Means nothing"

92,153 votes in favour of Boris Johnson:
"THIS IS A CLEAR MANDATE FOR NO DEAL"</div>
<div style='padding:5px;'>Boris Johnson's coronation as Tory leader and Prime Minister is a sad indictment of the state of modern Britain. 

Even after a career marked by incompetence, lies and vanity, if you have been to the right school and university, you can get the top job in the country. https://t.co/LXlTA04FTz</div>
